# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides an entry point to all OctoAcme project management process documents and a brief introduction to our approach.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme practices customer-focused, iterative delivery with clear ownership, measurable outcomes, and psychological safety at the core. Our approach ensures that every project follows a structured yet flexible lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution and tracking, release, and retrospective phases. This methodology enables teams to deliver value incrementally while maintaining high quality standards and stakeholder alignment.

Every project begins with a clear problem statement and success metrics defined during initiation. Planning establishes scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies, while execution involves building, testing, reviewing, and iterating based on continuous feedback. Throughout the lifecycle, we emphasize data-informed decisions, transparent communication, and proactive risk management to minimize surprises and maximize efficiency.

Responsibilities are clearly defined across key roles: Project Managers coordinate delivery and manage schedules and risks; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; Developers implement features with high quality and testability; UX Designers ensure usability and accessibility; Data Analysts provide metrics and insights; DevOps Engineers maintain reliable infrastructure and deployments; Security Leads ensure compliance and secure implementations; and Customer Advocates represent user needs and priorities. Each role collaborates closely to ensure alignment and shared understanding.

Our artifacts include project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, risk registers, and release plans—all maintained to provide transparency and enable effective decision-making. Communication is regular and purposeful, with weekly PM-PdM syncs, team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed. This cadence keeps everyone informed and ensures issues are surfaced and resolved quickly.
